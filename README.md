# Cryptography-Programs
These are some of the cryptography programs I wrote in grad school. This was written in Python 3.7.

## About
- The Midterm Folder contains programs for decoding and encoding numeric representation, Euclidian GCD, finding generators for numbers, multiplicative modular inverse, square and multiply operations. It also contains Simple ElGamal and RSA programs.
- The Final Folder contains programs to find generator and order on an elliptic curve and scalar multiplication over an elliptic curve for ECDH and Menezes-Vanstone EC Cryptosystem.
- The main programs in these two folders are SimpleElGamal.py, RSASimpleSignEncryptDecryptUnsign.py, FindAndOrderAllPointsOnEC.py, FindGeneratorPointForAnEC.py, FindOrderOfAPointOnEC.py, FindPubPriKeysForZeroKnowledge.py, and ZeroKnowledgeVerification.py. They aren't exactly complete programs as they were not intended for public use, only learning and usage during tests, midterm and final.
- All the other programs other than those listed above are supporting programs. This means that they are referenced in the above programs and are necessary to use the above programs. 
- **Usage:** Download the entire folders in their entirety and make sure that the main programs and supporting programs are in the same folder.
