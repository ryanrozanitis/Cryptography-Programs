# Cryptography-Programs
These are some of the cryptography programs I wrote during my second semseter at NJIT.

## About
- The Midterm Folder contains programs for decoding and encoding numeric representation, Euclidian GCD, finding generators for numbers, multiplicative modular inverse, square and multiply operations. It also contains Simple ElGamal and RSA programs.
- The Final Folder contains programs to find generator and order on an elliptic curve and scalar multiplication over an elliptic curve for ECDH and Menezes-Vanstone EC Cryptosystem.
